	* tests/emfs/check1.emf, tests/emfs/check3.emf:
	Updated to be the latest output from the library.

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.in:
	Added example1 and example2 as testing codes.

	* libemf/libemf.cpp:
	When PolyPolygon16 is called directly, compute the bounding box.

	* aclocal.m4, config.guess, config.h.in, config.sub, configure, ltmain.sh:
	Updated as a result of new versions of the autotools.

	* include/wine/w16.h: * Added the PolyPolygon16 structure and function

	* libemf/libemf.h, libemf/libemf.cpp:
	Added 16-bit metarecord for PolyPolygon when the coordinates are
	small enough.

	The nHandles value in the header is now one larger than the maximum
	handle created by the user. Evidently, w32 expects the StockObjects to
	count as one handle.

	* configure.ac:
	Updated for version 0.6 (using Autoconf 2.52, Automake 1.5c, and
	Libtool 1.4)
