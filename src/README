libEMF Version 1.0

libEMF is a library for generating Enhanced Metafiles on systems which
don't natively support the ECMA-234 Graphics Device Interface
(GDI). The library is intended to be used as a driver for other
graphics programs such as Grace or gnuplot. Therefore, it implements a
very limited subset of the GDI.

The only additional configuration option beyond the usual GNU
autotools options is --enable-editing, which activates the function
EditEnhMetaFile(). This will print the contents of a metafile in
memory to stdout.

The documentation starts at doc/html/index.html.

The software is available from SourceForge. See https://sourceforge.net/projects/libemf/
